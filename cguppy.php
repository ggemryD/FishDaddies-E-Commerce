    <ol>Caring for guppies involves providing them with a suitable environment, proper nutrition, and attention to their health. Here's a basic guide on how to care for them:</ol>
    <ul>Aquarium Setup:
        Guppies are small fish and can thrive in relatively small tanks, but they still need space to swim. A 10-gallon tank or larger is suitable for a small group of guppies.
        Provide hiding places such as plants, rocks, or caves to offer them security and shelter.
        Ensure the tank is properly cycled before introducing guppies to maintain water quality.</ul>
    <ul>Water Conditions:
        Guppies prefer slightly alkaline water with a pH between 6.8 and 7.8.
        Maintain a water temperature between 72째F and 82째F (22째C to 28째C).
        Regularly test the water for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels, and perform partial water changes to keep these parameters in check.</ul>
    <ul>Diet:
        Offer a varied diet to ensure they receive all the necessary nutrients. Commercial guppy flakes or pellets are a good base.
        Supplement their diet with live or frozen foods like brine shrimp, bloodworms, or daphnia to provide additional protein.
        Feed them small amounts multiple times a day, only giving them what they can consume in a few minutes to prevent overfeeding and water pollution.</ul>
    <ul>Tank Mates:
        Guppies are generally peaceful fish and can coexist with other peaceful community fish such as tetras, mollies, and platies.
        Avoid aggressive or large fish that may harass or prey on guppies.</ul>
    <ul>Breeding:
        Guppies are prolific breeders, so be prepared for population growth if you have males and females together.
        If you don't want them to breed, either keep only one sex or separate males and females.
        Provide dense plant cover for fry to hide from adult guppies, as they may eat their own young.</ul>
    <ul>Healthcare:
        Keep an eye out for signs of illness such as loss of appetite, lethargy, abnormal swimming behavior, or visible spots on the body.
        Quarantine new fish before introducing them to the main tank to prevent the spread of diseases.
        If you suspect a fish is sick, isolate it in a quarantine tank and treat with appropriate medications or seek advice from a veterinarian or experienced fishkeeper.</ul>
    <ul>Maintenance:
        Perform regular water changes (around 25% of the tank volume weekly) to remove waste and maintain water quality.
        Clean the tank, filter, and decorations periodically to prevent the buildup of debris and algae.</ul>
    <ul>By following these guidelines and providing proper care, you can enjoy healthy and vibrant guppies in your aquarium.</ul>
