        <ul>Caring for betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, involves creating a suitable environment, providing proper nutrition, and ensuring their overall well-being. Here's a guide to caring for bettas:
        </ul>
        <ul>Tank Setup:
            Provide a tank with a minimum size of 5 gallons for a single betta fish. Larger tanks offer more stable water parameters and room for enrichment.
            Bettas are labyrinth fish, meaning they can breathe air from the surface, but they still need access to clean, filtered water. Ensure there's minimal water movement to prevent stress.
            Decorate the tank with live or silk plants, smooth-edged ornaments, and hiding spots such as caves or driftwood.
            </ul>
        <ul>Water Quality:
            Maintain water temperature between 78째F to 80째F (25째C to 27째C). Use a heater to regulate temperature, especially in cooler climates.
            Bettas prefer slightly acidic to neutral water with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5. Regularly test water parameters and perform partial water changes (20-25% weekly) to maintain water quality.
            Use a gentle filter with low flow or baffled flow to prevent betta fins from being damaged.
            </ul>
        <ul>Feeding:
            Feed a high-quality betta pellet or flake food as the main diet. Look for foods with protein as the first ingredient.
            Offer occasional treats such as freeze-dried or frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, or daphnia.
            Feed small portions once or twice a day, only what they can consume in a couple of minutes to prevent overfeeding.
            </ul>
        <ul>Tank Mates:
            Bettas are often best kept alone due to their aggressive nature, especially males. However, some bettas may tolerate certain tank mates like small, peaceful fish or invertebrates in a larger tank with plenty of hiding spots.
            </ul>
        <ul>Healthcare:
            Keep an eye on your betta for signs of illness, including changes in behavior, appetite, or appearance.
            Quarantine new fish before introducing them to the main tank to prevent the spread of diseases.
            Treat any illnesses promptly and consult with a veterinarian experienced in fish care if necessary.
            </ul>
        <ul>Observation and Interaction:
            Spend time observing your betta to familiarize yourself with its normal behavior and appearance.
            Avoid tapping on the glass or making sudden movements that could stress the fish.
            Betta fish can recognize their owners and may enjoy interaction like gentle hand-feeding or playing with toys.</ul>
        <ul>By following these guidelines and providing a suitable environment, nutrition, and healthcare, you can ensure that your betta fish thrive and bring beauty to your aquarium.
        </ul>
